There are a lot of methods to identify if the systems is not working correctly and know where it is failing.

The problems are in the README.

The goal: find a systems that could detect anomalies in a systems without prior knowledge, real-time, with machine learning shenanigans.

Possible sections organisation:

- What are logs, what they are used for and what they can support/express.
	- auditing logs/plain text logs
	- Log information extracting for ML/DL models
- What are IDS/IPS systems and ML/DL based systems and anomaly detection. Different points of the whole groups of research
	- API-based ones
	- RNN analysis
- Problems with existing models for anomaly detection (domain-specific, ML-retraining, others...)
-
