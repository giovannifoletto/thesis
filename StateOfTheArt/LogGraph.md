This papers, published in 2023, is maybe the last in the context of anomaly detection on logs. It propose the problem on log collecting and analysing them on 24x7 active systems.

The papers, after have analysed the current state-of-the-art papers about this topics ([[DeepLog]], [[LogAnomaly]], [[LogRobust]])
