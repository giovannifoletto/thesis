The paper starting point is the fact that rule-based IDS systems cannot identify an anomaly behaviours based on static rules, even though the behaviour is coherent.  That, alone, allow to two slightly different malware to be blocked by them or pass through. 
The concept is that if the behaviour is coherent, a ML-based IDS could identify the anomaly.

> \[...\] Though their behaviours \[of malware\] are coherent, because of change in signature, static signature-based malware detection schemes would fail to identify such malware. \[...\]

The paper illustrate a possible solution using RNN ([[Recurrent Neural Networks]]), that has the capability to capture the feature of time-series and sequential data in order to study an executable behaviour to declare if its malicious or benign. In particular this system puts a lot of effort in monitoring the systems-call of the program analysed to obtain the results.
The training section is done with RNN-TSTM (RNN-Long Short Term Memory) model, in which the ranking of the feature is obtained with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverted Document Frequency).

The high-level working algorithm can be illustrated with this slide:

# Consideration

The systems proposal is really great, the use of system-API monitoring for behaviour is really neat. The techniques uses an advance methods of DL (deep-learning), so that can be tedious to understand, but they express results in term of $92\%$ accuracy, so it must surely be considered as a solution.
The papers fills out some point:
- anomaly detection in which are not followed patterns are going undetected more
- DL is clearly the way-to-go, since it conspicuous solution and positive results ($92.5 \%$ accuracy and average recall of $97\%$) derived by the application on this fields
- input the possibility of NLP (natural language processing) inside the evaluation of a possible malware [See the 11 resource for that]

PROS: good explanation of technologies used and available. First paper I see using NLP. Well elaborated conclusions, that evaluates the point of failures and goals reached. The paper specifically say that this model is capable of identify evolving unknown malware patterns.
CONS: thus not being a goal of this research, there are not point to think that this could work realtime. That could be track-down reproducing the code.

DATA SET: not clear yet => to finish the paper
ALGORITHM: have a github repository of the study.
