- difference about audit logs and systemd logs
	- Audit log: normaly already parsed. Normally it is easier to read this logs. 
- state of the art ? => YES, what happen in the papers, what they do and what algorithm they use. Intrested in algorithm, it is better
- Technical parts => not implementing nothing
- the mathematical part
- machine learning => some particular algo
- time => 24/11/2023
- it is possible


The goal is *real-time*.  find the correct feature of the logs that work with that at best.


The main work is in the middle.
Contextualize => abstract and introduction to know what is about. 
Why it is important => introduction and related works. 
Community => more or less the same guys in this moment
What the contribution is.

First time: identify what is addressing in the paper. Understand a notation and maybe the proof.
The paper is really doing what they are say the are doing?
If you what to correlate to work you put it on the front, but to set the area it is in the end.
arxiv.org => paper that have to be publish. And some sort of verification. Not peer-reviewed.

The idea ot tirocinio: test the algorithm and try to validate the better scenario. 

The conclusion there are summarized section.

=> misconfiguration techniques it's not the goal.
