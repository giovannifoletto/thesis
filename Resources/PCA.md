e Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method [39] assumes that there are different “sessions” in a log le that can be easily identied by a session id aached to each log entry. It rst groups log keys by session and then counts the number of appearances of each log key value inside each session. A session vector is of size n, representing the number of appearances for each log key in K in that session. A matrix is formed where each column is a log key, and each row is one session vector. PCA detects an abnormal vector (a session) by measuring the projection length on the residual subspace of transformed coordinate system. is approach is shown to be more effective than its online counterpart online PCA [38] especially in reducing false positives, but this is clearly an oine method and cannot be used for online anomaly detection. e implementation is open-sourced by [17].

Invariant Mining (IM) [22] constructs the same matrix as the PCA approach does. IM rst mines small invariants that could be satised by the majority of vectors, and then treats those vectors that do not satisfy these invariants as abnormal execution sessions. is approach is shown to be more effective than an earlier work [11] which utilizes workow automata. e implementation is opensourced by [17].
